        <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I have learnt that when I get frustrated, I need to take some time off in order to organize my thoughts. Also, in my opinion, EI is more important than QI. Understanding 
          yourself and knowing how to handle different situations might be more important than knowing how to do or get things done faster than others. Last but not least, be patient
          and resilient in this process.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
          I believe they play a crucial role in learning and programming because values like discipline, accountability and perseverance make all the difference in this process. 
          Also, during the learning process, we need to understand ourselves, and our feelings and have empathy with each other and help them to go through the process.    
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I've got surprised by how much I could learn while researching and thinking about subjects that are important but we don't care or don't talk about them every day.   
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I've spent a lot of time researching and it was a challenge for me to put it into words. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
          I think it is because you know that soft skills are as important as hard skills. Nowadays, companies do care about both of them.
        </p>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
          I believe the core content is quite extensive. I know it is important and we can learn a lot from it, but I think it is too much. For non-native English speakers, it is probably harder 
          because sometimes it is difficult to say what we really want due to lack of vocabulary or even because some subjects are not usually discussed or expressed in our culture, so I would say 
          Dev Academy should shrink it.
