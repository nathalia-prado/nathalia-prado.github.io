        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence is a Psychology concept created to define the capacity of each person to recognize emotions, deal well with and manage them.
          When we say emotions, we refer to ours and the others. This characteristic includes factors such as the ability to self-motivation, persistence, impulse control, emotion regulation, empathy and hope.
          A person with emotional intelligence is capable of working well with stress and others, being resilient and flexible in different situations.
        </p>
        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          IQ is the Intelligence quotient which is measured by cognitive abilities, and EQ is the Emotional quotient which is measured by emotional competency.
          IQ was created to choose people based on their ability to process information. 
          According to some experts, there is a debate against the use of a high IQ as a predictor of people's success. The IQ may play an important role but is not the only one. After all, you can be a very smart person, but if you don't know how to deal with your emotions, for example, it has a huge impact on your overall
          life, especially in your work environment. For this reason, the EQ is a characteristic which has been required in job interviews. They say IQ is just
          20% of our success in life, while EQ is 80%. They are opposite factores but complementary.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2> 
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence is important because a person who practices it has a better relationship with other people, develops self-knowledge, and 
          has empathy i.e. recognizes others' emotions and knows what peoples need, knows how to deal with a bad mood and excess of 
          excitement, increases productivity and has more chances to achieve goals and success in life.
