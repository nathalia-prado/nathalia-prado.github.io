              <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
                <p>
                My long term goal is to become a front-end software developer. I think technology is one of the fastest growing careers out there. 
                A career in technology will open up new opportunities around the world for me and I believe this path I took studying at Dev Academy will 
                help me, in a short period of time, to get a job in this field of work.
                </p>
              <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
                <p>
                My strength when it comes to learning is my determination. I work tirelessly on any project I have set my mind to until accomplish my goals.
                However, speaking English as a second language, sometimes I find it difficult to express myself. So it may take more time to finish
                more complex written tasks. But I am working on that.
                </p>  
               <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>        
                <p>
                While at Dev Academy, I would like to become a better problem-solver and improve my communication skills. It will help me to get ready for 
                the labour market and be prepared for a real work environment.

                <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
                <p>
                I am currently using the Toggl App to manage my time while working on a project. So that I don't spend more time than suggested for each task. 
                Also, I am not really a morning person, so I don't mind working later if needed, for example, if I get stuck. When things start to get to me
                I take a break to refresh my mind and I've noticed talking to someone, helps me to restart from the beginning. I like helping others, 
                and sharing what I learned and I don't mind asking for help when needed. However, as a newbie, the first thing when I get stuck I go to the
                Discord and see if someone has faced a similar problem and they usually have. So I can learn from other mistakes. If I can't find an answer 
                by google it and sort it out by myself, I ask for help.
                </p>
                <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
                <p>
                I expect the Facilitators to provide me with insights, and feedback and guide me through my learning process. When things get really hard, 
                an experient person can help with some valuable knowledge and wisdom. Having said that, I feel confident knowing I can count on them.
                </p>
                <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>  
                <p>
                I plan to have the same normal job routine so I work through the guide time box, and then I can keep my activities like going to the gym 
                and looking after my mental and physical health.
